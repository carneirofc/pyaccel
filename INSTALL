pyaccel
=======


REQUIREMENTS

Besides the requirements described in setup.py, which will be automatically
downloaded and installed, pyaccel depends on the trackcpp Python package,
available at https://github.com/lnls-fac/trackcpp. The version required is
specified in setup.py. Without a suitable version of the trackcpp package,
installation will fail.

To use pyaccel in interactive mode, the lnls-fac sirius package and Matplotlib
are required.


INSTRUCTIONS

Run 'python3 setup.py install' to install the package to a default directory.
Alternatively, 'python3 setup.py develop' can be used for development mode.
